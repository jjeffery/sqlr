sqlr -- SQL package
================================

Package `sqlr` is designed to reduce the effort required to implement
common operations performed with SQL databases. It is intended for programmers
who are comfortable with writing SQL, but would like assistance with the
sometimes tedious process of preparing SQL queries for tables that have a
large number of columns, or have a variable number of input parameters.
